# royal-clothing

This project is the culmination of a complete training that I carried out on the web application development in React.
It is a minimalist e-commerce application. It contains the essential elements for this type of application, namely :
* navigation between categories and products
* a registration and login process
* shopping cart management
* implementation of a means of payment
This project allowed me to deeply approach the different aspects of a web application developed in React and Redux but also to see other alternatives (Context API or GraphQL + Apollo).
In summary, a very good complete and formative project.
Technical Sheet
Code technologies I got involved with while working on this project.
* React.js : React router, Hooks, HOC pattern
* Redux & middleware : selectors and reselect, Redux logger, Redux persist, Redux saga (also seen Redux thunk)
* CSS3 with a first implementation in Sass then in Styled Components
* Firebase for authentication and shop data
* Stripe as a payment gateway shi 
* GitHub for source code management
It is Redux which is implemented in this version but I also explored Context API and GraphQL + Apollo as alternatives.
